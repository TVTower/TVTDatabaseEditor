# TVTower Database Editor

We want to build an Xtext-base editor for editing the TVTower database files.
With minimal development effort we want to provide as much support for editing entries for movies, news, ads. etc. as possible.

* code compleiton
* hover
* outline
* navigation to referenced objects
* validation
* ...

The actual xml files are edited for full control over the changes made (text diff between versions).

# Setting up the editor

A detailed [description for the setup](https://github.com/TVTower/Documentation/blob/master/database_editor/xtext_en/installation.md) and the general [documentation for the editor](https://github.com/TVTower/Documentation/blob/master/database_editor/xtext_en/main.md) can be found in the [TVTower documentation repository](https://github.com/TVTower/Documentation).

A standalone version exists.
Those familiar with Eclipse can set up the editor via the Eclipse installer using the setup file located at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TVTower/TVTDatabaseEditor/master/TVTDbEditor.setup`.

The Eclipse-Update site of the latest snapshot version is currently located at `https://www.nittka.de/download/tvtdb`.
